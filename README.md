Translate your locale files with AI Assistance.

Welcome to the ChatGPT + i18n app. This app is designed to help you translate your locale files with ease. Whether you are translating an application, website, or any other project that requires localization, it will make the process faster and more efficient.

I build this app because I was tired of using Google Translate to translate my locale files. I wanted to use a more efficient and accurate translation tool. ChatGPT, however, always break my json and cannot translate large contents. So I build this app to solve these problems. Hope you enjoy it.
